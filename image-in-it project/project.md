# Shoppy

**General:** In this project we will build an online shopping site using the following technologies:

* HTML, CSS, JS (ES5)
* json-server
* localstorage
* DOM manipulation and events

## Step 1 - showing products
* launch the server using db.json.
* display all the products in /products
* Each product will show it's image, title, price and an "Add to cart" button
* pressing "Add to cart" button will add the product to the cart area on the right.
  
## Step 2 - the cart

* the cart will display a line for each item, showing it's name and price
* at the bottom of the cart we'll show the total price and an "Order" button
* refreshing the page will keep the products in the cart (use localstorage)

## Step 3 - ordering

* pressing the "Order" button will add an order entity in the server, containing all the ordered product id's and the total price

## Software design

* remember DRY

## UI/UX
* the design will be a single page with the products on the left and the cart on the right.
* make it as beautiful as possible
